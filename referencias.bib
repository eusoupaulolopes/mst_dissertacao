	abstract = {The internet of things (IoT) is the integration of information space and physical space, becoming more and more popular in several places. In order to answer the complicated user request, most IoT devices do not work alone, a multiple service composition must be made, and it is defined as the services composition. A number of approaches to IoT’s service composition have been proposed in the literature. We have noticed a lack of studies that review the different works of the service composition in IoT. Thereby, in this paper, we present a review of existing approaches for service composition in IoT. It describes and compares them among each other with respect to some criteria, which we have defined based on the different challenges of service composition in IoT. Finally, we conclude by discussing open research issues and avenues for further work.},

System level low power optimization can significantly decrease the power consumption and increase system lifetime. Further, energy scavenging technologies have been proposed to improve the lifetime of such a system, up to perpetual operation. However, fixed duty cycle (active/sleep) operation can cause inefficiencies in the presence of variable input power; further, in cases of limited storage capacity and intermittent input power, the system's perpetual operation is not guaranteed. Energy forecasting algorithms can propose adaptable duty cycles, at the expense of heavy computing workloads. In this paper, we propose adaptable duty cycle operation for energy efficient IoT sensor nodes, utilizing a very simple -and very lightweight - scheduling algorithm that depends only on the periodical provision of the accumulator's state-of-charge. The proposed algorithm achieves energy balance in the presence of harvested energy and guarantees a minimum operation time in the absence of harvested energy. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Energy harvesting technology is becoming popular concerning efficient use of Internet of Things devices, which collect energy present in nature and use it to power themselves. Although the technology is eco-friendly, it is dependent on the vagaries of the surrounding environment; the amount of energy produced is sensitive to the weather and terrain, and intermittent power threatens the system’s stability. Thus, it is essential to collect data that can determine the circumstances of the surrounding environment. Furthermore, these systems should be designed efficiently for continuous energy harvesting. This efficiency can vary depending on the system’s configuration. Core voltage levels and frequencies typically influence efficiency. To maximize system efficiency, power management with an appropriate combination of controllable factors is necessary. We design an energy harvesting system for real-time data acquisition. We propose a methodology to guide the optimal operating power stage considering various adjustable factors for efficient operation. Also, we propose an adaptive operating power mode management model, which involves selecting the optimal operating power step and the transition to a low-power mode (LPM) during idle time. The proposed model was applied to an actual energy harvesting system to demonstrate its effectiveness and facilitated the operation of the harvesting system at low power. © The Author(s) 2020.},

We address the problem of maximizing the throughput of a system consisting of rate-adaptive EH nodes that transmit to a destination. Unlike related literature, we focus on the practically important discrete-rate adaptation model. First, for a single EH node, we propose a discrete-rate adaptation rule and prove its optimality for a general class of stationary and ergodic EH and fading processes. We then study a general system with multiple EH nodes in which one is opportunistically selected to transmit. We first derive a novel and throughput-optimal joint selection and rate adaptation rule (TOJSRA) when the nodes are subject to a weaker average power constraint. We then propose a novel rule for a multi-EH node system that is based on TOJSRA, and we prove its optimality for stationary and ergodic EH and fading processes. We also model the various energy overheads of the EH nodes and characterize their effect on the adaptation policy and the system throughput. © 2014 IEEE.},

To minimize the requirement of external power source and maintenance for electric devices such as wireless sensor networks, the energy harvesting technique based on vibrations has been a dynamic ﬁeld of studying interest over past years. One important limitation of existing energy harvesting techniques is that the power output performance is seriously subject to the resonant frequencies of ambient vibrations, which are often random and broadband. To solve this problem, researchers have concentrated on developing eﬃcient energy harvesters by adopting new materials and optimising the harvesting devices. Particularly, among these approaches, diﬀerent types of energy harvesters have been designed with consideration of nonlinear characteristics so that the frequency bandwidth for eﬀective energy harvesting of energy harvesters can be broadened. This paper reviews three main and important vibration-to-electricity conversion mechanisms, their design theory or methods and potential applications in the literature. As one of important factors to estimate the power output performance, the energy conversion eﬃciency of diﬀerent conversion mechanisms is also summarised. Finally, the challenging issues based on the existing methods and future requirement of energy harvesting are discussed.},

In this context, EWSNs have two distinct features that set them apart from monitoring systems in other application domains. They are often deployed in remote areas, preventing the use of mains power and precluding regular visits to exchange batteries. At the same time, their surroundings usually provide opportunities to harvest ambient energy and use it to (partially) power the sensor nodes.

However, the randomness inherent in the EH process may cause signiﬁcant delay for performing sensing operation and transmitting the sensed information to the sink. Unlike most existing studies on the delay performance of EH sensor networks, where only the energy consumption of transmission is considered, we consider the energy costs of both sensing and transmission. Speciﬁcally, we consider an EH sensor that monitors some status property and adopts a harvest-then-use protocol to perform sensing and transmission. To comprehensively study the delay performance, we consider two complementary metrics and analytically derive their statistics: (i) update age - measuring the time taken from when information is obtained by the sensor to when the sensed information is successfully transmitted to the sink, i.e., how timely the updated information at the sink is, and (ii) update cycle measuring the time duration between two consecutive successful transmissions, i.e., how frequently the information at the sink is updated. Our results show that the consideration of sensing energy cost leads to an important tradeoff between the two metrics: more frequent updates result in less timely information available at the sink.},

However, in some of the sensor networking applications, an additional facility is available to ameliorate the energy problem: harvesting energy from the environment. Certain considerations in using an energy harvesting source are fundamentally different from that in using a battery, because, rather than a limit on the maximum energy, it has a limit on the maximum rate at which the energy can be used. Further, the harvested energy availability typically varies with time in a nondeterministic manner. While a deterministic metric, such as residual battery, suffices to characterize the energy availability in the case of batteries, a more sophisticated characterization may be required for a harvesting source. Another issue that becomes important in networked systems with multiple harvesting nodes is that different nodes may have different harvesting opportunity. In a distributed application, the same end-user performance may be achieved using different workload allocations, and resultant energy consumptions at multiple nodes. In this case, it is important to align the workload allocation with the energy availability at the harvesting nodes. We consider the above issues in power management for energy-harvesting sensor networks. We develop abstractions to characterize the complex time varying nature of such sources with analytically tractable models and use them to address key design issues. We also develop distributed methods to efficiently use harvested energy and test these both in simulation and experimentally on an energy-harvesting sensor network, prototyped for this work.},

	abstract = {Power management in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is crucial due to the limited battery energy. Energy harvesting wireless sensor networks (EH-WSNs) can extract energy from environmental sources to break this limitation. Consistent with the nodes’ energy collection and workload, adaptive energy management strategies are used to improve energy utilization, thereby making the system perform efficiently and operate sustainably. Solar-powered sensor nodes in the network are grouped into clusters. Data collected by cluster members are sent to the cluster head and finally transmitted to the base station. The goal of the whole network is to maintain an energy neutrality state and to maximize the effective data throughput in the network. This paper proposes an adaptive power management method based on reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for the solar-powered sensor networks. RL methods are applied for adjusting the transmission rate for each node to keep harvested energy more balanced among the whole clustered network. The Q-learning and the latest proximal policy optimization (PPO) methods are applied to maximize transmitting sensing data over the whole network. Experiments show that both methods are suitable for performing energy management by better adjusting the duty cycle of each node to achieve the overall application goal of maximizing information transmission.},

We address the problem of maximizing the throughput of a system consisting of rate-adaptive EH nodes that transmit to a destination. Unlike related literature, we focus on the practically important discrete-rate adaptation model. First, for a single EH node, we propose a discrete-rate adaptation rule and prove its optimality for a general class of stationary and ergodic EH and fading processes. We then study a general system with multiple EH nodes in which one is opportunistically selected to transmit. We ﬁrst derive a novel and throughput-optimal joint selection and rate adaptation rule (TOJSRA) when the nodes are subject to a weaker average power constraint. We then propose a novel rule for a multi-EH node system that is based on TOJSRA, and we prove its optimality for stationary and ergodic EH and fading processes. We also model the various energy overheads of the EH nodes and characterize their effect on the adaptation policy and the system throughput.},

In DSR, each sensor node is allowed to adjust its duty-cycle according to the current amount of residual energy only. Since the residual energy of nodes in energy-harvesting WSNs can increase over time due to their harvesting opportunity, the estimation of prospective increase in their residual energy is useful to achieve our goal. Hence, DSP allows each of sensor nodes to reduce its duty-cycle more aggressively in proportion to such an increase. Through NS-2 simulations, we veriﬁed that our proposed schemes outperform the duty-cycle scheduling scheme used in a representative existing MAC protocol such as RI-MAC.},

Energy consumption caused by operating these sensors cannot be overlooked, especially for long-term IoT network operation. Inactivating some of the unneeded sensors during the operation is one of the feasible solutions. Recent studies have mainly focused on selecting the unneeded sensors in a duty-cycled manner based on the sensor’s geographic location or the sensor’s communication status. These studies involve obtaining some of the user’s private information, moreover, anomaly detection performance, a signiﬁcant criterion regarding IoT network operation performance has not been considered. In this paper, we develop a novel activation/inactivation strategy for long-term IoT network operation. In this strategy, a machine learning model is adopted to adaptively select the unneeded sensors to be inactivated during network operation. Moreover, to maintain high sensor data processing performance during long-term operation, by only using the basic sensor data (e.g., temperature and humidity), our proposal selects the unneeded sensor candidates which are periodically updated. Numerical experiments conducted in two IoT network environments over seven-month operation verify the effectiveness of our proposal.},

We consider a sensor that is harvesting energy from an ambient radio-frequency (RF) signal and using this energy to perform sensing and transmission. Since energy harvesting is time-varying in nature, it introduces a delay in the sensor transmissions. We study two delay-related metrics, one measuring how frequent the sensed information is updated at the sink and the other measuring the time taken from the sensing operation to successful transmission of sensed information. We analytically characterize the statistical behavior of both metrics and ﬁnd an important tradeoff between them. In particular, our results illustrate that more frequent update of sensed information at the sink increases the time taken from the sensing operation to successful transmission of sensed information.},

First, we show that the optimal throughput of an EH node is upper bounded by the throughput achievable by a node that is subject only to an average power constraint. We then propose a simple transmission scheme for an EH node that achieves an average throughput close to the upper bound. The scheme’s parameters can be made to account for energy overheads such as battery non-idealities and the energy required for sensing and processing. The effect of these overheads on the average throughput is also analytically characterized.},

In this paper, an energy efﬁcient periodic distributed data reduction technique is proposed. Our technique allows each sensor node to search the variation between readings collected at each period based on the Kruskal-Wallis model. Then, the sensor selects a set of representative readings instead of sending the whole readings collected during a period to the sink. To evaluate the performance of our technique, simulations on a publicly available real sensor data followed by experiments in a real-world telosB sensor network testbed have been performed. Compared to other existing approaches, we are able to achieve up to 80\% communication reduction while maintaining a high level of data accuracy.},

On the other hand, energy saving is urgently required by many energy-constrained IoT devices. This paper studies the energy-age tradeoff for status update from a sensor to a monitor over an error-prone channel. The sensor can sleep, sense and transmit a new update, or retransmit by considering both sensing energy and transmit energy. An inﬁnite-horizon average cost problem is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) with the objective of minimizing the weighted sum of average AoI and average energy consumption. By solving the associated discounted cost problem and analyzing the Markov chain under the optimal policy, we prove that there exists a threshold optimal stationary policy with only two thresholds, i.e., one threshold on the AoI at the transmitter (AoIT) and the other on the AoI at the receiver (AoIR). Moreover, the two thresholds can be efﬁciently found by a line search. Numerical results show the performance of the optimal policies and the tradeoff curves with different parameters. Comparisons with the conventional policies show that considering sensing energy is of signiﬁcant impact on the policy design, and introducing sleep mode greatly expands the tradeoff range.},

However, this comes at the cost of losing the predictability in the operation of the sensor nodes. This loss of predictability is particularly problematic for the battery life, as it determines when the nodes need to be serviced. In this paper, we propose an energy and relevance-aware monitoring method, which leverages the principles of self-awareness to address this challenge. On one hand, the relevance-aware behavior optimizes how the monitoring efforts are allocated to maximize the monitoring accuracy; while on the other hand, the power-aware behavior adjusts the overall energy consumption of the node to achieve the target battery life. The proposed method is able to balance both behaviors so as to achieve the target battery life, at the same time is able to exploit variations in the collected data to maximize the monitoring accuracy. Furthermore, the proposed method coordinates two different adaptive schemes, a dynamic sampling period scheme, and a dual prediction scheme, to adjust the behavior of the sensor node. The evaluation results show that the proposed method consistently meets its battery lifetime goal, even when the operating conditions are artificially changed, and is able to improve the mean square error of the collected signal by up to 20\% with respect to the same method with the relevance-aware behavior disabled, and of up to 16\% with respect the same algorithm with just the adaptive sampling period or the dual prediction scheme enabled. Consequently showing the ability of the proposed method of making appropriate decisions to balance the competing interest of its two behaviors and coordinate the two adaptive schemes to improve their performance.},

	abstract = {Energy harvesting computing has been gaining increasing traction over the past decade, fueled by technological developments and rising demand for autonomous and battery-free systems. Energy harvesting introduces numerous challenges to embedded systems but, arguably the greatest, is the required transition from an energy source that typically provides virtually unlimited power for a reasonable period of time until it becomes exhausted, to a power source that is highly unpredictable and dynamic (both spatially and temporally, and with a range spanning many orders of magnitude). The typical approach to overcome this is the addition of intermediate energy storage/buffering to smooth out the temporal dynamics of both power supply and consumption. This has the advantage that, if correctly sized, the system ‘looks like’ a battery-powered system; however, it also adds volume, mass, cost and complexity and, if not sized correctly, unreliability. In this paper, we consider energydriven computing, where systems are designed from the outset to operate from an energy harvesting source. Such systems typically contain little or no additional energy storage (instead relying on tiny parasitic and decoupling capacitance), alleviating the aforementioned issues. Examples of energy-driven computing include transient systems (which power down when the supply disappears and efficiently continue execution when it returns) and power-neutral systems (which operate directly from the instantaneous power harvested, gracefully modulating their consumption and performance to match the supply). In this paper, we introduce a taxonomy of energy-driven computing, articulating how power-neutral, transient, and energy-driven systems present a different class of computing to conventional approaches.},

	abstract = {For decades, the design of untethered devices has been focused on delivering a fixed quality of service with minimum power consumption, to enable battery-powered devices with reasonably long deployment lifetime. However, to realize the promised tens of billions of connected devices in the Internet of Things, computers must operate autonomously and harvest ambient energy to avoid the cost and maintenance requirements imposed by mains- or battery-powered operation. But harvested power typically fluctuates, often unpredictably, and with large temporal and spatial variability. Energy-driven computers are designed to treat energy-availability as a first-class citizen, in order to gracefully adapt to the dynamics of energy harvesting. They may sleep through periods of no energy, endure periods of scarce energy, and capitalize on periods of ample energy. In this paper, we describe the promise and limitations of energy-driven computing, with an emphasis on intermittent operation.
